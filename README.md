A simple node-red node that provides basic control of 1602 LCD's with i2c driver backpacks (using PCF8574P drivers).

Tested on Raspbian Jessie and should work with all RPi models.


Requirements:

- i2c-lcd (available in npm repo, but may require a manual compile since the i2c library v0.1.x do not compile on current node versions)

-
